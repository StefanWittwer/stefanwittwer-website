With multiple built-in redudancies, this solution is highly reliable – even if the internet connection or servers go offline.\n\nDisplays using this technology can be remotely managed via SALIOREL Manager, which makes it easy to configure displays, present web content remotely and push news and announcement to displays and users of the SALIOREL Platform.\n\nToday, this solution is used by the Kantonsschule Zürcher Oberland.",
