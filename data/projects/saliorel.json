  "story": "SALIOREL was created back in 2014 as a simple website to check the KZO timetable and has evolved into a sophisticated application, used over 1.6 million times in total.\n\nThe current version of saliorel.com allows KZO students and teachers to check their timetables, cafeteria menues and more – with a full grade calculator and school planner included. Previously, the iOS and Android app named \"saliokan\" was also available for over 18+ cantonal schools in and around Zurich.\n\nSoon, these platforms will converge in the new SALIOREL 6 – the best version yet – that is more modern and more useful than ever before.",
