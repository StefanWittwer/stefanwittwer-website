  "story": "\"It's about didactics, rather than technology.\"\n\nSALIOREL Education is a new digital learning platform, specifically designed for use in a BYOD classroom setting. In the context of my matura project, I conceptualized, designed and developed a prototype for this platform.\n\nThanks in part to the great reception of the matura project and the pressing need for such a platform which emphasizes the actual content rather than the technology, this platform might be further developed in the future as a side-project of mine.",
